# mosquito-gis

Static website created to show results of Spring 2020 Mosquito Population Analysis independent study for the Midwest Center of Excellence for Vector-Borne Diseases (MCEVBD). 

The focus of this project was digitizing catch-basins and mosquito traps in Milwaukee County, as well as creating a relational database tracking mosquito larvae levels. The static website was created to display the findings. Because the focus of the project was GIS, in the interest of time creating the website, the bulk of the text was formated using Microsoft Word-converted html documents. Those documents (index_page.html and maps_page.html) were then referenced from index.html and maps.html. The navigation bar and slideshow container code was pulled and adapted from code examples on w3schools.com.

Nav bar adapted from https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar_horizontal.asp

Slideshow adapted from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp
